Song of the Builders 
Mary Oliver 

On a summer morning/ 
I sat down/ 
on a hillside/ 
to think about God -/ 
a worthy pastime./ 
Near me, I saw/ 
a single cricket;/ 
it was moving the grains of the hillside/ 
this way and that way./ 
How great was its energy,/ 
how humble its effort./ 
Let us hope/ 
it will always be like this,/ 
each of us going on/ 
in our inexplicable ways/ 
building the universe./
