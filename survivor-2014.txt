Survivor 2014 
 PAMELA SNEED 

 Contrary to what’s popular I never liked Diana Nyad/
 in my mind overrated white woman/
 ex-olympic swimmer most recently swam from Cuba to Florida/
 privileged/
 thrill seeker/
 daredevil/
 doing voluntarily what so many people of color/
 are forced to do while attempting to gain freedom/
 drowning in boats, falling overboard, terrible accidents,/
 falling into the jaws of sharks, those waters a meat fest/
 for predators, slavers/
 Sometimes I think about slavery and think if only those waters/
 could tell the tale/
 I’ve always wanted to say to those people who go on the reality-show Survivor for kicks/
 try being an artist and make it your career choice/
 or how about a single mother or father trying to raise a family/
 on minimum wage living in an impoverished area/
 try being someone who comes to America and/
 doesn’t speak the language whose entire survival rests upon/
 learning english/
 arriving in a strange land, on strange soil, estranged from everything/
 you have ever known/
 like hitting your head against a glass door, or mirrors/
 like optical illusions that used to be in the old fun houses/
 or how about being uninsured and being sick for a number/
 of years/
 weathering that storm/
 or insured but burdened with a costly illness/
 health plans don’t cover/
 or like so many of my students who are bullied to the point/
 they have nowhere to turn and no longer have knowledge/
 of their own name/
 No I never liked Diana Nyad/
 until one day I caught a clip of her on Ellen/
 I caught the part where she talked about her friendship/
 with Superman Christopher Reeve who in real life suffered/
 paralysis from the neck down./
 He looked at her in later years after she’d retired from swimming/
 said he feared she wasn’t living her own dreams, that/
 she was an Olympian/
 And something about her conversations with him motivated her/
 to try again, to listen./
 Maybe through her I saw the frayed ends of my own un-lived dreams,/
 my own fear that caused paralysis/
 And so by the end of that conversation with Ellen/
 where Diana talked about returning to her Olympic Self/
 by swimming from Cuba to Florida at age 60 challenging/
 every notion of what it means to be an athlete, a woman,/
 and the stereotypes of aging I was crying/
 by the time she looked into the camera and said/
 Never give up/
 Don’t ever give up on your dreams
