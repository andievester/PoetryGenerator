The Tradition 
JERICHO BROWN 

Aster. Nasturtium. Delphinium. We thought/ 
Fingers in dirt meant it was our dirt, learning/ 
Names in heat, in elements classical/ 
Philosophers said could change us. Star Gazer./ 
Foxglove. Summer seemed to bloom against the will/ 
Of the sun, which news reports claimed flamed hotter/ 
On this planet than when our dead fathers/ 
Wiped sweat from their necks. Cosmos. Babyâ€™s Breath./ 
Men like me and my brothers filmed what we/ 
Planted for proof we existed before/ 
Too late, sped the video to see blossoms/ 
Brought in seconds, colors you expect in poems/ 
Where the world ends, everything cut down./ 
John Crawford. Eric Garner. Mike Brown.
